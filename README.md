# Feature-Engineering-for-classification

In this little notebook, I will bring together various techniques for feature engineering that we have covered in Meduim article to tackle a classification problem. This would give you an idea of the end-to-end pipeline to build machine learning algorithms for classification.

I will:

build a gradient boosted tree
use feature-engine for the feature engineering steps
set up an entire engineering and prediction pipeline using a Scikit-learn Pipeline
